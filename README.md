# HAVOK_review
Final project for the Laboratory of Computational Physics course from the master degree in Physics of Data at the Unversity of Padua.
This work has been supervised by professor Jeff Byers. This is a review of the famous work done from Brunton described in the paper "Chaos as an 
intermittently forced linear system" where we try to see its applications and test its limits and issues.
